True or false questions.

Choose True or False for each statement below.



1. __False_ Good software should deliver only the required functionality and performance to the user.


2. __True_ Software engineering is a more general process of system engineering.


3. __True_ According to the author of our course text book, roughly 70% of software costs are development costs, 30% are testing costs.


4. __False_ System models are used during requirements engineering to help explain the proposed requirements to system stakeholders.


5. __True_ Sequence diagrams show interactions between actors and the system and between system components.


6. __True_ One use of a graphical model is to document an accurate and complete representation of a system.


7. __True_ Architectural design is concerned with understanding how a software system is organized.


8. __False_ System characteristics include web user interfaces, performance, security, availability, and maintainability.


9. __False_ Identifying object classes is simple by following process steps outlined in requirements documentation.


10. __True_ Software design and implementation is the process of transforming specifications and models to executable software components.




Answer the following questions.




11. Define what system modeling is.





	System modeling simplified is like a diagram of some sort that shows the components of the system and how they connect or interact with each other.

12. Name system perspectives and what each perspective is modeled for.
	I cannot answer this question. Couldnt find it in the book and dont know what Im looking for on the web.






13. Describe differences between activity diagrams and sequence diagrams.





	I believe the difference is that the sequence diagram shows how each component responds to each other whereas the activity diagram is more like a flow chart where it is set up to show the process of each component from start to finish. 

14. Name three architectural design decisions.





	Security
	Performance
	Availability	

15. What are common activities of design processes?








		THESE ANSWERS ARE STRAIGHT FROM THE BOOK

	Software specification
		-the process of understanding and defining what services are required from the system and identifiying the constraints on the system's operation and development.

	Software design and implementation
		-the process of developing an executable system for delivery to the customer.

	Software validation
		-is intended to show that a system both conforms to its specification and meets the expectations of the system customer.
	Software evolution
